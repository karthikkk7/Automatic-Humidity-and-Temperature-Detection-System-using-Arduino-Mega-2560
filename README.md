Automatic Humidity and Temperature Detection System using Arduino Mega 2560
📖 Project Overview
The Automatic Humidity and Temperature Detection System is designed to monitor real-time temperature and humidity levels using the DHT11 sensor and display the readings on a 16x2 LCD. It visually indicates temperature conditions using two LEDs:

Yellow LED: Lights up when the temperature is ≥ 35°C
Blue LED: Lights up when the temperature is < 35°C
This system is ideal for simple weather stations, greenhouse monitoring, or home automation applications.

⚙️ Pin Configuration
DHT11 Sensor
VCC → 5V on Arduino
GND → GND on Arduino
DATA → Pin 8
16x2 LCD (in 4-bit mode)
RS → Pin 1
E → Pin 2
D4 → Pin 4
D5 → Pin 5
D6 → Pin 6
D7 → Pin 7
LEDs
Yellow LED → Pin 9
Blue LED → Pin 10
White LED → Pin 11 (optional)
🧪 How It Works
The DHT11 sensor continuously reads temperature and humidity.
Readings are displayed on the LCD.
LED indicators respond to the temperature:
≥ 35°C: Yellow LED turns ON
< 35°C: Blue LED turns ON
🔧 Libraries Required
Make sure to install the following libraries via the Arduino Library Manager:

LiquidCrystal
DHT (by Adafruit or compatible)
🚀 Getting Started
Connect the components as per the pin configuration.
Upload the Arduino sketch to your Mega 2560 board.
Open the Serial Monitor or observe the LCD and LEDs for live readings and indicators.
📌 Notes
Ensure correct power supply for sensors and components.
You may adjust the temperature threshold (35°C) in the code to fit your use-case.
Make sure the DHT11 is not exposed to moisture or direct sunlight for accurate results.
